# KMS for PGP/GPG
[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Farber-salihi%2Fkmspgp.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Farber-salihi%2Fkmspgp?ref=badge_shield)


This tool allows you to use [AWS KMS][aws-kms] asymmetric keys as if they were
PGP/GPG keys. (Only for signatures for now.)

This can be useful if you have CI/CD pipelines signing code or artifacts and
you don't wish to do all the hassle of proper cryptographic key management.

It's also useful if you wish to use AWS CloudHSM keys via the KMS API for
PGP/GPG operations.

## How to use?

Download the latest release from the Github Releases page. Since this is a Java
project you can get the Jar, distribution Zip (which you can conveniently
install on any OS) or a GraalVM native-image build for a fat binary that only
depends on the OS and architecture (no Java needed).

`kmspgp` only runs when the proper AWS credentials are set. It uses the AWS SDK
defaults which obey environment variables, profile files and/or instance
metadata credentials.

You should have already created an asymmetric key for signing/verification
only in KMS, and have the proper access to the key (`DescribeKey`,
`GetPublicKey` must be allowed). To list keys additionally the `ListKeys`
action should be allowed.

### Listing keys

You can list all usable keys with the `list` subcommand.

### Exporting a key

Exporting a key in the PGP/GPG format so that it can be shared publicly is done
using the `export` subcommand. You must pass the `--user-name`, `--user-email`
options wich govern the PGP/GPG user ID (`NAME <EMAIL> (COMMENT)` format).

Exporting requires the `Sign` action to be allowed, since it performs a signing
operation.

Usually you do this once, and then share the exported file.

### Signing data

You can sign data by using the `sign` subcommand. It reads from `STDIN` and
then signs the data using the provided key.

### GPG fallback mode for Git signing

You can use `kmspgp` in GPG fallback mode to sign Git commits. In your Git
project specify the following configuration:

```
git config --local gpg.program <PATH-TO-KMSPGP>
git config --local user.signingkey <KMS-KEY-ARN>
git config --local commit.gpgsign true
git config --local tag.forceSignAnnotated true
```

Whenever you call `git commit` you would need AWS credentials setup so that
signing can take place.
